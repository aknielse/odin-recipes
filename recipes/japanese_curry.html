        Ingredients:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Onions</li>
        <li>2 Carrots</li>
        <li>2 Large golden potatoes</li>
        <li>4 Cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>4 Curry blocks/cubes</li>
        <li>1 or 2 Chicken breasts/thighs or other protein</li>
        <li>1 Carton of chicken stock (recipe needs about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 Tbs of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tsp of ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tbs of ketchup</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> 2 Tbs of lime or lemon</li>
        <li>1 Tbs of sesame oil or neutral oil</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Pinch of pepper</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> Instant-pot to cook in</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Prepare the ingredients.</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Skin and quarter 2 golden potatoes into 2 inch chunks. Soak the potato chunks in a bowl of cold water.</li>
            <li>Cut the 3 onions in half, and then into 5 wedges each.</li>
            <li>Peel and chop the 2 carrots into 1 inch pieces. Roll the each carrot 1/4 after each cut to allow proper cooking.  This is so you can increase the surface area of each piece of carrot when it cooks.</li>
            <li>Cut your protein.  In this recipe we'll be using 2 chicken breasts.  Cut your chick into 1 inch slices.  Make sure to cut diagonally, like the carrots, to increase surface area and thorough cooking. Then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mince 4 cloves of garlic.</li>
            <li>Peel and grate 1-2 tsp(s) of ginger and mix with the garlic.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><h4>Start cooking the curry.</h4></li>
        <ol>
            <li>If using an Instant-pot, set it to Saute mode (low). Once heated, add 1 tbs of oil.</li>
            <li>After adding in the oil, add in the onion wedges, along with the garlic and ginger mixture.</li>
            <li>Wait about 5 or until the onions have started to soften, and then add the carrots, potatos (without the water), and chicken (in that order).</li>
            <li>Fill the pot up with 2 cups of chicken stock (or until it covers most of the mixture except the top).</li>
            <li>Place 4 curry blocks on the top. Make sure they are not touching the chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Switch the Instant-pot to Pressure-cook mode (high pressure) or stew/soup mode and cover with pressure lid for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the Instant-pot is done, release the pressure and take off the lid.</li>
            <li>Mix the stew mixture together for 30 seconds or until the curry cubes are dissolved, then add the 1 tbs of soy sauce, 2 tbs of citrus (optional) and 1 tbs of ketchup.</li>
            <li>Lightly mix again and then switch the Instant-pot back to Saute mode for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><h4>Enjoy your Japanese curry!</h4></li>
        <ol>    
            <li>Switch-off the Instant-pot (set to warm if needed).</li>
            <li>Your Japanese curry is now done!  Please enjoy over rice and/or with katsu!</li>
        </ol>
